# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. I made a few changes to take the app to the next level.   
  
### Purpose
The purpose of my app was to improve the established app.  Weather description was added to the weather data on the app. I then added input statements to the app to filter the data based on vacationers weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the vacationers will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, the app will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## World Weather Analysis Results
Jack was able to plan a trip based on his weather preferences.
